# Calandar
t's just a Calendar application I want to write in Java with the Help of a Scene Builder. It should have some features like the possibility of planning your Days and getting reminded of your Happenings. Some other features I'm planning to do is a search function to search for Happenings, support for repeating events and import or export of data in iCal format.
And maybe some more or other features.
